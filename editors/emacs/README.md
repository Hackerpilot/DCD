#EMACS Integration

This is a first cut at emacs support.  It is far from complete.

##Requirements
* You must have the [auto-complete](https://github.com/auto-complete/auto-complete) package
* This integration will not automatically start dcd-server, so you'll have to do hat yourself.
* Make sure dcd-client is in your path
* Add the following to your .emacs

        (require 'ac-dcd)
        (add-to-list 'ac-modes 'd-mode)
        (defun ac-d-mode-setup ()
          (setq ac-sources (append '(ac-source-dcd) ac-sources))
          (global-auto-complete-mode t))
        (add-hook 'd-mode-hook 'ac-d-mode-setup)
