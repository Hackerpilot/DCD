dcd-server can be configured through the use of a file called
.I dcd.conf
This file should be placed in one of the following locations:
.IP \(bu
.I $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dcd/dcd.conf
.RE
.IP \(bu
.I $HOME/.config/dcd/dcd.conf
.RE

Each line in the file should be a path to search for D source files. A line in
.I dcd.conf
is equivalent to passing that same line to
.B dcd-server
with the
.I -I
option.
